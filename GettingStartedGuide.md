# Getting Started with PulsarCoin

If you have any questions about PulsarCoin (PLSR) that are not answered on the website, the [PulsarCoin Discord](https://discord.gg/7feEVsvDj9) has many active members who can answer your questions or direct you to someone who can.

## 1. Get the Pulsar Wallet

Before you can acquire PLSR you need a place to store it. See the [Windows wallet setup guide](WindowsGUI-WalletSetup.md) or the [Linux CLI wallet setup guide](LinuxCLI-WalletStakingSetup.md) for step-by-step instructions to install the Pulsar wallet and get an address to deposit your PLSR.

Another option is to sign up for an online [Beehive Wallet](https://beehivewallet.link/index) to store and stake your PLSR. While the official Pulsar wallet is recommended, Beehive Wallet is a convenient option for those who plan to stake and hold PLSR.

**NOTE**: It's critical to keep a backup of your `wallet.dat` file. This file contains your private keys and without them you will lose acess to any PLSR stored in your wallet. See the [Windows Backup Guide](WindowsGUI-Troubleshooting.md#back-up-your-wallet) for instructions.

## 2. Buy or Mine Your First PLSR

The fastest way to acquire your first PLSR is to buy it. [Exbitron](https://www.exbitron.com) offers BTC, LTC, and BUSD trading pairs.

If you have a computer you can also mine PLSR. See the [Pulsar Mining Guide](MiningGuide.md) for details.

## 3. Stake Your PLSR to Earn More

One of the features of PulsarCoin is the ability to stake your coins from your own wallet. There is no huge minimum collateral amount or node that has to be hosted; Any amount over 1 PLSR can be staked from the official Pulsar wallet on your regular PC.

To stake, you must have at least 1 PLSR in your wallet, and your wallet must be unlocked and have at least 1 active connection. The more PLSR you have in your wallet, the greater your chance of getting a staking reward. If you have less than 1000 PLSR you may want to try pooled staking with [Beehive Wallet](https://beehivewallet.link/index) to get small, regular rewards.
